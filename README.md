# How It Works:
### Before running app, make sure to run NPM Install to load in needed Modules
### - If Install doesn't work you'll have to manually install fs, request, node-spotify-api and chalk before it will run correctly.

### Now you may choose which search you would like to begin by inputing one of the following commands into the command line,


<h4>
- ***node liri.js spotify-this-song "song name here"*** to return song information from Spotify. If no song is entered, The Sign by Ace of Base will be returned.
  
- ***node liri.js concert-this "artist/band name here"*** to return concert information from Bandsintown. 
  
- ***node liri.js movie-this "movie name here"*** to return movie information from OMDb. If no movie is entered, a reccomendation for a movie will be displayed.
  
- ***node liri.js do-what-it-says*** to return a set of random Queries --- this is the information stored in random.txt
</h4>
